This is the natural language description of an event: Long lunch with Bob next Thursday.

The current date is Friday 2025-02-21 so next Thursday is 2025-02-27.
The lunch will start at 12:00 and end at 14:00.
The location is the usual place.

Please generate an event model conforming ot the following structure:

```typescript
type Event = {
  // These should be RFC 3339 timestamps
  startDate: string;
  endDate: string;
  // A brief description of the event
  summary: string;
  location: string;
  // If the event is not recurring, this field should be omitted. It should be an RFC 5545 RRULE string otherwise.
  // It should NEVER be an empty string.
  recurrenceRule?: string;
};
```
