# EXO Developer Documentation Overhaul

This documentation is a working plan and draft for improving the EXO project documentation, with a focus on developer onboarding, contributing, and clarity.

## Project Status

- The main README and public docs have not kept pace with the vibrant development and collaboration happening in the EXO community.
- EXO is actively developed and supported by contributors from leading companies, with most real-time activity on Discord.
- Requests for Work (RFW) are now the main way to get involved, replacing the old bounty system.
