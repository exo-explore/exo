    "- Devices connect peer-to-peer (no master-worker), and models are partitioned across available memory.\n",

    "- Public diagrams are limited and often lack detail or clarity for developers.\n",
    "- The most insightful visuals are generated by EXO itself during runtime, showing live cluster topology and model partitioning.\n",
    "- There is a need for simple, static diagrams in the docs to help new developers understand the basics.\n"
